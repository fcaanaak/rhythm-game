TODO:

- Map out all the states found in the level editor and how they transition
	eventually wanting to transition to using a State design pattern for level editor

- Cover functionality found in each state in detail, plan which inputs do what and 
	which new nodes or scenes will have to be created and how they interact with whats already there
	

- General refactoring
